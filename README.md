# ProjectSnake — Asset Variants

This project includes two types of assets: **brutal** and **non-brutal** versions.  
By default, the game uses the **brutal** variant, but you can switch them at any time.

## How to change the asset set

1. Copy and Replace the desired asset folder into the project's `Assets` directory.
2. Open **Visual Studio**.
3. Go to **Build → Rebuild Solution**.

After rebuilding, the game will automatically load the new textures.

## Notes
- No code changes are required.
- The engine will pick up the replaced assets on the next build.
